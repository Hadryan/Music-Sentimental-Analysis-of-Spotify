# Music-Sentimental-Analysis-of-Spotify
Scraped out the Top Tracks of Spotify of 2018 through the Spotify Web API and “Spotipy” library.
Performed Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy Libraries.  
Analyzed the trends of the track features and arrived at a conclusion that danceability, energy and valency were the most desirable features in a song.
